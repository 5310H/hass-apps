Contributing
------------

You are welcome to contribute your own apps for AppDaemon to this
project. But please don't submit a pull request without talking to
me first. This is because there is currently no developer documentation
on how to integrate properly with the environment provided by hass-apps
and I want to save you the hassle of re-designing your app after it's
already written.

If you've got an interesting idea for a new app you'd like to contribute,
just open an issue on GitHub and we can discuss it there.

Please note that all contributions are subject to the `Code of Conduct
<CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html>`_. Don't contribute if you don't aggree with that.


Roadmap
-------

Currently, the following enhancements are planned.

* Nothing concrete


Donations
---------

I work on this project in my spare time, as many free software developers
do. And of course, I enjoy this work a lot. There is no and will never be
a need to pay anything for using this software.

However, if you want to donate me a cup of coffee, a beer in the evening,
my monthly hosting fees or anything else embellishing my day a little
more, that would be awesome. If you decide doing so, I want to thank you
very much! But please be assured that I'm not presuming anybody to donate,
it's entirely your choice.

Support the continuous development with a small monthly donation: |paypal-recurring|
