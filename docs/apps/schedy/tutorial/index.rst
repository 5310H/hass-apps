In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up a basic heating schedule with Schedy.


Objective
---------

The goal is to have Schedy control thermostats in a flat with four rooms,
a **living room**, a **bedroom** and two **kids rooms**. In the living
room, there are two radiators, hence we've got two thermostats there.

In each room, there's a window with window sensor attached. We want the
heatings in the particular room to be turned off when a window is opened
and the previous setting be restored when it's closed again.
