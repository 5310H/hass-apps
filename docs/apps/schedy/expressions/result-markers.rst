Result Markers
==============

.. include:: /advanced-topic.rst.inc

A result generated by an expression can optionally be marked with some
pre-defined markers that influence how the result is handled.

Instead of

::

    - x: "21"

you write

::

    - x: "Mark(21, Mark.OVERLAY)"

to mark the result ``21`` with the ``OVERLAY`` marker.

The actual syntax is ``Mark(result, marker1, ..., markerN)``,
so you can add multiple markers ad once. Markers can be applied to
:doc:`postprocessors <postprocessors>` as well, but they will be used
for the final result.

The following markers are available:

* ``OVERLAY``: Overwrite manual value adjustments even when a configured
  ``rescheduling_delay`` would normally have prevented it.
  As soon as the schedule no longer evaluates to an ``OVERLAY``-marked
  result the previous value is restored, no matter if that was the
  scheduled or a manually set one. Even a previous re-scheduling time
  is restored.
  An occasion for using this marker is
  :doc:`../tips-and-tricks/open-window-detection`.
