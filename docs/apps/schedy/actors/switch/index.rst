Switch
======

The ``switch`` actor is used to control binary on/off
switches. Internally, it's a `generic actor <../generic/index.html>`_,
but with a much simpler configuration, namely none at all.


Supported Values
----------------

You need to return the strings ``"on"`` or ``"off"`` from your schedules
for the switch actor to work. It's as simple as this.
