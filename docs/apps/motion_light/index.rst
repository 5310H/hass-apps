motion_light
============

.. warning::

   motion_light is deprecated in favour of :doc:`/apps/schedy/index`,
   which is much more sophisticated, general-purpose and
   future-proof. Please migrate your existing configuration over to
   Schedy.
   motion_light will be removed soon.

This app can turn devices on/off according to the state of sensors.
The most obvious use case is controlling lights when motion sensors
report motion, but other scenarios are imaginable as well. Delays and
constraints can be configured freely for each individual sensor.
